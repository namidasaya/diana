		<p><strong>God Bless The Broken Road Selah Sheet Music</strong>. I set out on a narrow way many years ago Hoping I would find true love along the broken road But I got lost a time or two Wiped my brow and kept pushing through I couldnt see how every sign pointed straight to you Every long lost dream led me to where you are Others who broke. Dec 28 2015 - My 10 year old daughter created this video interpretation of Selahs version of God Bless the Broken Road for my wedding. I think about the years Ive spent just passing through Id like to take the time I lost and give it back to you But you just smile and take my hand Youve been there you understand Its all part of this grander plan that is coming true CHORUS.
